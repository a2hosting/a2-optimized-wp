## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does A2 Optimized speed up my site?

Caching is the fastest and easiest way to speed up a dynamic website.
A2 Optimized will install and configure the best available caching method with the click of a few buttons.

### Does A2 Optimized make all sites faster?

A2 Optimized will speed up most sites; however, not all plugins and themes are compatible with all optimizations.
If your site is slower after enabling caching in A2 Optimized, talk to a developer about finding better solutions for the plugins that you are using.

### Can I use A2 Optimized with WordFence?

A2 Optimized is compatible with most of the features in WordFence, however you should disable caching and logging in WordFence. Also, if page caching in A2 Optimized is enabled, some WordFence features that required WordPress to be fully loaded may not trigger.

### Can I use A2 Optimized on any host?

Yes.  A2 Optimized works on any host that supports WordPress; however, A2 Hosting provides a few more tools for speeding up your site when hosted on an A2 Hosting server.
